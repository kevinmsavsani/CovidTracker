# CovidTracker

● Here content is scraped from https://www.mohfw.gov.in/   <br />
● I have not scraped website for every client request, added cache in server so it provide data from cache and regularly update cache  <br />
● Visualised the data on the frontend in a presentable manner. Cases, deaths, recovered etc. for India and for each state.  <br />
● The application is responsive, i.e. should display properly on mobile , tablets and desktop  <br />
● Implemented service workers and cache results for 2 minutes on the client side using service workers.  <br />
● deployed the project on https://www.heroku.com/ - https://pwa-covid-tracker.herokuapp.com/   <br />
● Made the data interactive [ sorting, filtering etc.]   <br />
● visualised the same data on an interactive map   <br />
